Automated Project Creation
A tech team should consider automating project creation with **Cookiecutter** when **any of the following conditions are met**:

---

### 🔁 **1. Frequent Creation of Similar Projects**

If your team repeatedly builds similar types of projects (e.g., FastAPI services, Django apps, microservices), manual setup becomes inefficient and error-prone. Cookiecutter can enforce consistent structure and configuration.

**Example:**
Spinning up multiple microservices with FastAPI that share structure, Docker, CI/CD, auth, etc.

---

### 📋 **2. Need for Standardization Across Projects**

When your organization needs **consistent conventions** for:

* Project layout
* Configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `pyproject.toml`, `Dockerfile`)
* Linting and formatting tools (e.g., `black`, `ruff`)
* Testing framework setup
* CI/CD workflows

Cookiecutter ensures **uniformity**, making onboarding and collaboration smoother.

---

### 🚀 **3. New Team Members or Scaling Dev Teams**

If new developers are joining or you're scaling the team, Cookiecutter reduces the **onboarding time**. Instead of documenting setup steps, they can generate fully configured projects with a single command.

---

### 🧪 **4. Multiple Environments or Deployment Targets**

If your projects need to support different environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod) or infrastructures (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS Lambda), Cookiecutter can offer template options or conditional generation logic.

---

### 🛠 **5. Too Much Boilerplate**

When a lot of setup is **repetitive** (copy-pasting Dockerfiles, CI scripts, user auth logic), Cookiecutter eliminates this, reducing human error and speeding up productivity.

---

### 🧩 **6. You Maintain Internal Tooling or Libraries**

If you maintain SDKs, CLI tools, or frameworks used across multiple teams or departments, Cookiecutter helps wrap them in a **starter project** that developers can build on immediately.

## ✅ Summary: Start using Cookiecutter if...

| Situation                                    | Use Cookiecutter? |
| -------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| Same project setup used repeatedly           | ✅ Yes             |
| Growing team or onboarding often             | ✅ Yes             |
| Maintaining consistent standards is critical | ✅ Yes             |
| Setup involves lots of copy-pasting          | ✅ Yes             |
| Projects are still very unique and ad hoc    | ❌ Not yet         |
